### About Me

I am a final-year **Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** student at **MNNIT Allahabad (Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad)**, with a keen interest in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **competitive programming**, and **mobile app development**. Throughout my academic career, I have honed my skills in **machine learning**, **data science**, and **algorithm design**, and have actively participated in numerous competitive programming contests, improving my problem-solving abilities and algorithmic thinking.

In addition to my passion for AI, I have developed and deployed several **Android** and **iOS** applications, gaining hands-on experience in **mobile app development**. My experience with tools like **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Flutter**, and **Swift** has helped me create intuitive and efficient applications that cater to real-world needs. I am particularly interested in exploring how AI can be integrated into mobile platforms to create intelligent, user-friendly applications.

As a **competitive programmer**, I have developed strong analytical and coding skills, regularly solving challenges on platforms like **Codeforces**, **LeetCode**, and **HackerRank**. These experiences have not only sharpened my coding skills but also taught me how to approach complex problems with a methodical mindset.

As I near the end of my undergraduate studies, I am excited to apply my diverse skill set in AI, mobile app development, and problem-solving to contribute to innovative projects and solve meaningful real-world challenges.
